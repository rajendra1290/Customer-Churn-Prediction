Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to discontinue using their service. This project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict churn based on customer data and behavioral patterns.

Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will churn using historical data. The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Multiple machine learning models are compared to find the best performing one.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Python Libraries

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical computations

Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

Matplotlib – Data plotting and graphing

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model building and evaluation

Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each algorithm was trained and tested to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Model comparison helps identify which performs best for churn prediction.

Project Workflow

Data Collection – Load dataset (CSV file)

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends and patterns in churned vs retained customers

Model Training – Apply multiple algorithms and tune hyperparameters

Model Evaluation – Compare models based on performance metrics

Result Visualization – Display insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Insights

Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed the best in terms of balanced accuracy and interpretability.

Customers with low engagement, shorter tenure, and lower monthly charges were more likely to churn.



Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn and assist companies in taking proactive measures to retain customers.
